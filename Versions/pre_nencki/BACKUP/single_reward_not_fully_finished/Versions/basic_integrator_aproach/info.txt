Basic, kinda working implementation with static network of basic sensory circuit for locomotion.
It cannot evolve desired behaviour, which I think is due to the fact that given netowrk isn't quite right for what we expect from it. It is simplified version and totally ignores entire locomotion system, which is hugely important, especially for getting response. We should be able use it without implementation of locomotion system, but it'd require right decoder, which would nicely catch signal intended for locomotory system. The same holds true also for fitness score, which is a matter of great importance in geneticc algorithms and it is bacically the only factor determining structure of evolved netowrk.
The decoder and fitness in this implementation cerainly doesn't belong to those well suited ones described above.
