This is basically the same as basic_integrator_aproach with different implemntation of scoring method in Specimen class. This results in actually nicely working GA capable of learning to perform constant forward movement without stimuli. It is important to note the fact that this implementaiton is not capable of backward movement. It'd have to be encoded as a two pairs of neurons, but currently there is only single one.
