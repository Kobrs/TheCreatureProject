# Celegans motoric circuit case
This case is studying the neural circuit of locomotion in (Karbowski, 2013), where the synaptic polarity of part of motoric neural netowrk in C. *elegans*. It also includes olfactory system as in Celegans_motor case.

WARNING: It is in really early stage, so basically there is no useful code in here.
